**Breast-Cancer-Classification
This project aims to analyze and classify breast tumor types (benign or malignant) using Machine Learning models, specifically Na√Øve Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The dataset used is Breast Cancer Wisconsin from Scikit-Learn, which has gone through a cleaning and processing process before being used for model training. In this project, the data is divided into training and test data to evaluate the model's performance in accurately classifying breast cancer.
The main objective of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of two Machine Learning algorithms in detecting breast cancer. The model created is expected to provide accurate predictions, so that it can be the basis for supporting decision making in the early diagnosis of breast cancer.
From this project, an important insight was gained that the selection of Machine Learning models should consider the trade-off between accuracy and risk of misclassification. In the case of breast cancer, errors in classifying malignant tumors as benign can have serious repercussions, so models with high recall for the malignant tumor class are preferred.
As a suggestion for further development, this model can be optimized with data balancing, feature selection, or hyperparameter tuning techniques to improve prediction accuracy and stability. In addition, combining multiple models (ensemble learning) or applying deep learning techniques can be an alternative to improve breast cancer classification performance. Finally, integration of the model into a web-based system or application can provide greater benefits for medical personnel and patients in supporting early diagnosis efficiently.
